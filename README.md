🎓 Final Year B.Tech Project

Color and Skin Analysis Using Deep Learning

🧠 Project Title:
Color and Skin Analysis Using Deep Learning for Personalized Skincare Recommendations

⸻

📌 Project Overview:

This project focuses on analyzing facial images to determine skin type, color tone, and texture using advanced computer vision and deep learning techniques. It leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and image preprocessing algorithms to extract features and classify skin types (oily, dry, combination, normal) and tone (fair, wheatish, dark), enabling intelligent recommendations for skincare products or regimens.

⸻

🎯 Objectives:
	•	To develop a deep learning model capable of analyzing facial images and identifying skin tone and type.
	•	To build an AI-based solution that personalizes skincare advice.
	•	To explore real-world applications in dermatology, cosmetics, and health-tech industries.

⸻

🧪 Tech Stack Used:
	•	Programming Language: Python
	•	Frameworks/Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
	•	Model Type: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
	•	Frontend (optional): Streamlit or Flask for demo interface
	•	Data: Public skincare and face image datasets (e.g., CelebA, DermNet)
	•	Tools Used: Google Colab, Jupyter Notebook, VS Code, GitHub

⸻

🔬 System Architecture:
	1.	Image Preprocessing: Cropping, resizing, and normalization of facial images.
	2.	Feature Extraction: Using CNN layers to learn skin features (tone, pores, oil patterns).
	3.	Classification Model: CNN-based model classifies input into skin types and tones.
	4.	Output Layer: Gives label prediction with confidence score.
	5.	Recommendation Engine (Optional): Suggests skincare routines or products based on the classified skin type and tone.

⸻

📈 Model Performance:
	•	Accuracy Achieved: ~92% on test set
	•	Loss Function: Categorical Crossentropy
	•	Optimizer: Adam
	•	Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, Confusion Matrix
